# Introducing IoT Ensemble

IoT Ensemble automates a best practice Azure IoT cloud for rapidly connecting devices and ingesting and processing device data for cloud-based applications. IoT Ensemble is one of Fathym’s three tools for assembling cloud-based applications, alongside the [Fathym Platform](https://www.fathym.com) and [Habistack](https://www.fathym.com/forecast).

IoT Ensemble is an out-of-the-box and intuitive control system for connecting devices, understanding data and integrating with application templates and downstream services. Easy to hook up devices to the cloud and initiate the flow of device data, IoT Ensemble automatically splits ingested device data into 3 streams – hot, warm and cold data flows.

- The hot flow gives near-real-time information via web sockets and/or message queuing directly into applications such as dashboards.
- The warm flow and its database are accessible via built-in REST API and route data into a time-series window for analytics, alerts, dashboards and more.
- The cold flow is the “absolute truth,” raw sensor data – also accessible via built-in REST API for AI/ML and deep analytics.

IoT Ensemble operates as a virtual development team that automates best practices for cloud-based IoT application delivery, augmenting your team’s skills by handling the heavy lifting and radically reducing the time and work involved.

## Device > Cloud > App

IoT Ensemble in combination with the Fathym platform is a powerful **Device-to-Cloud-to-Applications suite**. The Fathym platform offers pre-configured automations, open-source app templates and streamlined DevOps to assemble and launch cloud-based apps and dashboards auto-populated with device data from IoT ensemble.

Alongside the Fathym platform and Habistack, IoT Ensemble is available as a hosted SaaS. IoT Ensemble and Fathym’s tools can also be licensed to run on your own Azure cloud for maximum control and data security, avoiding vendor lock-in or compromising future development pathways.
